 - so here is the remedy: also track journal* in all branches, but track only journal* in journal branches. at the end of a work day, merge journal* in all branches back into journal branch. Also a way to practice merge?
 - to sum up work of today:
 	- dev and master branch with initial commit
	- journal branch a total mess :-____-:, finally fix it (hope so)
	- lots of amend commits make the gitks ugly ...
	- relearn makefile format
 - to be continued:
 	- public api in sudoku.h
