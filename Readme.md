#### Simply put

1.	gitsud is a small exercise project to improve my git skills.
2.	gitsud solves a sudoku puzzle, but the program itself, again, is not my main focus.
3.	For now, only me and one computer.

#### In detail

Yet another practice of git. githello is a stupid idea since hello world is far too easy to adopt the so called GitFlow approach. So I choose sudoku to practice git a little bit more. (Remeber the sudoku homework assigned in Programming Design I in freshman year? Makes me feel nostalgic ~~)

	Again, for gitsud, the main focus is still on git practice instead of the program itself. And this time, comments and documentation should be more complete since THERE IS something for me to explain. :XDDD:

	A word about the GitFlow.

	- Branches are cheap (but maybe not easy at the beginning ...).
	- master, develop, feature, release, hotfixes and test/ experimental branches
		- master vs release, latest production ready codebase vs pre-release
		- I am still confused by develop and hotfix?
	- I would also create a journal branch to keep a project development journal (or I don't know what it's actually called.) about the bugs, thoughts related to the project. For notes about git or other linux utility, I will keep them else where.
	- And also semantic versioning 2.0.0 is worth a read.
		- http://semver.org/
	
	Finally, I do not  plan to spend lots of time on doing this project. About 30 minutes or more per day is enough? Still got lots of work to do ...
